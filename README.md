Tidy Data-set from Samsung accelerometer readings
========================================================
- Unzip the source ( https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip )

into a folder on your local drive, say C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\

- Put run_analysis.R to C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\UCI HAR Dataset\

in RStudio: setwd("C:\\Users\\yourname\\Documents\\R\\UCI HAR Dataset\\")

and then: source("run_analysis.R")

- The latter will run the R script, it will read the dataset and write these files:

- tidy_dataset.txt

- The script normally runs for 5 to 10 seconds, but the exact number depends on your system.

Use data <- read.table("tidy_dataset.txt") to read the latter. It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30*6=180 rows. Note that the provided R script has no assumptions on numbers of records, only on locations of files.
